11	South Wales & Celtic Manor	south-wales-celtic-manor	# South Wales & Celtic Manor\r\n\r\nSouthern Wales is home to some of the UK’s most spectacular coastlines which has lent itself to the creation of some of the most stunning links courses in Europe. Not only is the South coast of Wales home to such an array of breathtaking links courses, it is also home to Celtic Manor which shot to the forefront of golf when it hosted the 2010 Ryder Cup matches. \r\n\r\nThis impressive array of golfing options is backed up by outstanding accommodation, wonderful beaches that are perfect for surfing and of course the local towns and villages where a warm welcome awaits. \r\n\r\nFamous names in Welsh golf including Royal Porthcawl and the James Braid designed Pennard Links may end up being the highlights of this tour but they will face stiff competition from some of the country’s lesser known hidden gems. Pyle & Kenfig may not draw the same plaudits as its more illustrious neighbours but it is a truly magical links course that will set the heart racing if the wind gets up. Machynys Peninsula is home to the first Jack Nicklaus designed golf course in Wales and while it looks out over Carmarthen Bay it is by no means a traditional links course and as such will provide some glorious variety to the golf tour.\r\n\r\nMoving on from the Dragon Hotel in Swansea golfers will head to Celtic Manor for the remainder of the tour where they will be treated to the picturesque Roman Road Course, five star accommodation, amazing restaurants and of course the Twenty Ten Course. The Twenty Ten Course was the first golf course to be purpose built for the Ryder Cup and a round here is a truly special and atmospheric experience; perfect for wrapping up a golf tour of South Wales.	2011-08-30 16:19:21.794488	2011-09-13 14:36:39.794344	tours	51.677665,-2.809753	9	Wales	South Wales & Celtic Manor Golf Tours | Your Golf Tours	\N

20	Royal Troon	royal-troon	#Royal Troon\r\n\r\nFounded in 1878 by a few enthusiasts Troon Golf Club soon outgrew its purely local reputation.\r\n\r\nThe Old Course today presents a stern golfing examination and in particular the inward half of Royal Troon is widely accepted as the most demanding of any Course on the Championship rota.\r\n\r\nOne of the great links courses in Scotland, the Old Course is a challenging test of golfing ability. With the wind to contend with, and deep rough interspersed with gorse and broom, accurate shot making is essential. Players should make their scores on the outward nine, as the prevailing north-westerly wind can make the back nine extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nCharles Hunter, "Keeper of the Green" at Prestwick Golf Club, supervised the clearance of the ground and the laying out of the first five-hole Course. A sixth hole was added during 1879, with further extensions firstly to twelve holes and then to eighteen, which was completed in 1885. The development to twelve and then to eighteen holes was agreed by a group of enthusiasts along with George Strath the Club’s Professional. Further changes were undertaken on the recommendations of Willie Fernie, Strath’s successor. Prior to the 1923 Open Championship alterations were made on the advice of James Braid.\r\n\r\nIn men’s golf, the Club has hosted the Amateur Championship on four occasions, the Scottish Amateur Championship on five occasions, the Scottish Open Amateur Stroke-play Championship on one occasion and the Men’s Home International Championships on four occasions.\r\n\r\nIn ladies’ golf, the Ladies British Open Amateur Championship has been played at Troon on four occasions and the Scottish Ladies Close Amateur Championship on five occasions.\r\n\r\nThe Club is situated on the West Coast of Scotland 35 miles south of Glasgow and close to the County Town of Ayr. Panoramic Views of the Firth of Clyde, looking out to the Isle of Arran and Ailsa Craig, (Paddy’s Milestone) will immediately delight and enthral the first time visitor. Prestwick Golf Club and Turnberry Golf Club are both within easy driving distance of Royal Troon, each having a history of Open Championship golf participation.	2011-08-31 14:03:28.597774	2011-09-13 10:38:44.121333	courses		\N	Scotland	Royal Troon Golf Tours | Your Golf Tours	One of the great links courses in Scotland, the Old Course is a challenging test of golfing ability.

22	Kingsbarns	kingsbarns	#Kingsbarns\r\n\r\nThere are several courses in the St Andrews area and Kingsbarns, which is located just outside the town, is a must play.\r\n\r\nGolf was played there for many years in the 1800’s but it was the 1990’s when Kingsbarns benefited from a massive redevelopment and is now regarded as one of Scotland’s best courses.\r\n\r\nThe Kingsbarns Golf Links site has long been known for its intimate connection with the sea. The fact that it`s golf origins date back to 1793 is testimony to the attributes of the site which foster ideal conditions for links turf to flourish amid interesting natural terrain.\r\n\r\nThis unique part of East Fife has sandy soils, undulating ridges and hollows, Cambo burn running into the sea, all set immediately against the rugged coastline of the North Sea.\r\n\r\nKingsbarns has marked the name of Kyle Phillips on the golfing map with a bang, as praise has been gushing for the dramatic coastal layout; the humps, hollows and dunes that have been carefully scuplted combine to form outstanding holes like the 12th, a striking par-5 that wraps its way along the shores with the beach in easy reach, and also the 15th, a phenomenal short hole across the water.\r\n\r\nThe non-membership model means that Kingsbarns has an open, welcoming atmosphere, with a small but extremely comfortable clubhouse that overlooks the treacherous final green. The golf course is within a few minutes of St Andrews and the Fairmont Resort, making it accessible - this is arguably the best course to be opened in the UK in decades, so be sure you don't miss out. Kingsbarns is open from April through October.	2011-08-31 14:04:48.23664	2011-09-08 15:35:12.239315	courses		\N	Scotland	Golf at Kingsbarns, St Andrews, Scotland | Your Golf Tours	The Kingsbarns Golf Links site has long been known for its intimate connection with the sea.

Risk and reward is a recurring theme, and the layout has been created with high profile tournament golf in mind.\r\n\r\nFast run-off areas lead to perfectly manicured greens around the sparking Faldo design, all overlooked by a luxury resort and operated with country club style service. The North Western provinces of Ireland are best known in golfing terms for their fine array of championship links courses, but Lough Erne adds a different perspective, and is a fine addition to high quality golf tour.	2011-08-31 15:58:55.896842	2011-09-08 15:38:18.635746	courses		\N	Ireland	Golf at Lough Erne, Ireland | Your Golf Tours	The golf course designed by Sir Nick Faldo at the stunning Lough Erne Resort has been lavished with praise since its recent opening, and undoubtedly ranks as one of the finest new courses in the world.

The golf course is a genuine test, long and at times penal, striking an interesting balance between southern European and American design traits.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reason behind the styling is that the layout was penned by Cabell Robinson, an American architect who has been prolific in producing high class projects on the Costa del Sol.\r\n\r\nBrave enough to head back to the tournament tees?

27	Gleneagles King's Course	gleneagles-kings-course	#Gleneagles King's Course\r\n\r\nThe King`s Course, which opened in 1919, is a masterpiece of design that has tested the aristocracy of golf, both professional and amateur. \r\n\r\nWhen Lee Trevino first played the King`s he memorably remarked:"If Heaven is as good as this, I sure hope they have some tee times left."\r\n\r\nJames Braid`s plan for the King`s Course was to test even the best players` shot-making skills over the eighteen holes. When they play the King`s the world`s greatest golfers admire the cunning and craft with which he achieved that goal.\r\n\r\nYou find out all about it with your first approach shot. If you have driven straight and long from the tee, you will have what looks like a simple pitch to the elevated green. But you must be sure to select the correct club, because the shot is always a little longer than you think, with the wind over the putting surface often stronger than you can feel it from the fairway. And if you do not make the severely sloping green, a bunker yawns twenty feet below.\r\n\r\nSelecting the right club for each approach shot is the secret on the King`s. It is certainly one of the most beautiful and exhilarating places to play golf in the world, with the springy moorland turf underfoot, the sweeping views from the tees all around, the rock-faced mountains to the north, the green hills to the south, and the peaks of the Trossachs and Ben Vorlich on the western horizon.\r\n\r\nAll the holes have evocative and pithy Scots names. For example, the fifth, "Het Girdle" (Hot Pan), is a challenging par 3 with trouble every-where except on the green, while the 7th`s moniker, "Warslin` Lea" (Wrestling Ground), reflects the difficulty so many golfers have had with this long, sweeping par 4.\r\n\r\nYou are spoiled for choice at the Gleneagles Resort with three excellent courses. The new PGA Centenary Course will host the 2014 Ryder Cup matches and unlike many Scottish courses has buggies available.	2011-08-31 14:17:19.00355	2011-09-08 15:32:17.252492	courses		\N	Scotland	Golf at Gleneagles - King's Course | Your Golf Tours	The King`s Course, which opened in 1919, is a masterpiece of design that has tested the aristocracy of golf, both professional and amateur.

The eighteen holes of Gullane No.1 Course were established in 1884. The well maintained greens, links grasses, numerous bunkers and sea breezes make a unique challenge for the serious golfer.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd hole was recently voted one of the top 500 holes in the world by Golf Magazine (USA).

19	Ailsa Course, Turnberry	ailsa-course	# Ailsa Course, Turnberry\r\n\r\nLong regarded as one of the finest courses in the world, the Ailsa came to international prominence with the famous "duel in the sun" between Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson over the four days of the 1977 Open.\r\n\r\nIt was then, in brilliant sunny weather, that a capacity crowd was treated to an exhilarating display of golf from two of the best golfers the world has ever known.\r\n\r\nPolls now regularly acknowledge the Ailsa as one of Britain`s top three courses, confirmation that gives it eminence worldwide, with regular rankings within the world's top 20 courses.\r\n\r\nThe first three holes pose a fairly tough opening, particularly when the wind blows from the direction of Ailsa Craig, the dramatic rock 11 miles out to sea.\r\n\r\nFrom the admirable short fourth to the short 11th the Ailsa Course follows the shoreline, the fifth to the eight framed by dunes and the ninth, tenth and eleventh flanked by craggy rocks. It is a thrilling passage full of stout hitting.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the ninth is Turnberry's trademark, the remote tee has been moved further out these days and is set on a rocky premonitory on the edge of the sea, the drive across the corner of the bay and a glimpse of the site of Bruce's Castle (Robert the Bruce, Scottish King, 1306-1329). The narrow path to the tee and the tee shot itself are not recommended to those of a nervous disposition.\r\n\r\nThe scenic glories of the Ailsa Course are to be savoured - the granite dome of Ailsa Craig, the low form of the tip of Argyll and the peaks of Arran highlighting the changing patterns of light and shade. Closer at hand, The Lighthouse, and the ninth`s lovely back tee are other symbols of Turnberry, the hole`s title adding an historic echo.\r\n\r\nA golfing trip to Scotland would not be complete without a round on one of the world`s greatest courses.

61	North Berwick West Links	north-berwick-west-links	#North Berwick West Links\r\n\r\nThe North Berwick Golf Club is the thirteenth oldest in the world, founded in 1832 by a group of local landowners and gentlemen, among them a soldier who fought in Napoleon`s final defeat at Waterloo.\r\n\r\nA list of past captains on the wall in the clubhouse proudly displays a distinguished past - Knights, Earls, Lords, Marquis and a former British Prime Minister, A.J.Balfour. This heritage is still reflected in the present membership.\r\n\r\nThe WEST LINKS was originally six holes and a seventh was added before it was extended to 18 holes in 1877. By 1895 the course was lengthened, and today measures 6420 yards S.S.S 7 1. Not the longest, but the trickery of the course requires the full repertoire of shotmaking.\r\n\r\nA true links course laid out on a raised-beach, laden with brown sand forming the undulating links land 10 to 30 feet above sea level. Although the architect is unknown many of the holes have been copied by designers all over the world, including the 376 yard 14th named "Perfection" and the 192 yard 15th called "Redan". A golfing experience not found anywhere else, with blind holes, drives over walls and burns, shots over the bay and bunkers deep enough for the golfer to disappear from view.\r\n\r\nNot only is the links venerable but it is one of the most attractive and stimulating links courses anywhere, with every hole setting a different problem of length, judgement, skill and direction. The long 11th was also unashamedly reproduced by Donald Ross as Seminole`s 18th (Florida, USA). The 12th, `Bass` embodies risk/reward strategy at its finest while the 13th, `Pit` combines strategic dimensions with old world quirkiness.\r\n\r\nAfter `Perfection`, the 14th, the golfer moves on to the world famous `Redan`, a 192 yard par 3, that Bernard Darwin described more than 85 years ago as "a beautiful one shot hole atop a plateau with a bunker short of the green, to the left, and another further on to the right, and we must vary our mode of attack according to the wind, playing a shot to come in from the right or making a direct frontal attack".\r\n\r\nThe West Links is a true links with commanding views of the sea, over great wide sandy beaches, across the dark rocky islets of the Forth estuary to the green-hilled Fife coast, the volcanic grey and white streaked hump of the Bass Rock and distant May Island on the horizon.	2011-08-31 15:16:40.498501	2011-09-08 15:43:27.199331	courses		\N	Scotland	Golf at North Berwick West Links, Scotland | Your Golf Tours	The West Links is a true links with commanding views of the sea, over great wide sandy beaches, across the dark rocky islets of the Forth estuary to the green-hilled Fife coast, the volcanic grey and white streaked hump of the Bass Rock and distant May Island on the horizon.

23	Carnoustie Championship Course	carnoustie-championship-course	#Carnoustie Championship Course\r\n\r\nCarnoustie does not introduce itself gently.

Since it is slightly uphill and frequently into the prevailing westerly wind, this is probably just as well.\r\n\r\nThough the pros have rarely dropped shots here, it is by no means a soft touch. The humps and hollows on the fairway (ironically called an "elephants graveyard" by Hale Irwin!) and the blind second shot into a hidden green with countless slick borrows, make this a tough starting hole.\r\n\r\nCarnoustie has hosted the Open Championship on 7 occasions with the last being in 2007 when Padraig Harrington won in a play-off against Sergio Garcia. 1999, however, may be the most remembered finish when Jean Van de Velde had a disastrous triple bogey on the 72nd hole and then lost in a play-off to local man Paul Lawrie.\r\n\r\n	2011-08-31 14:06:53.62085	2011-09-09 16:42:31.129241	courses	56.350034,-2.081909	8	Scotland	Golf at Carnoustie - Championship Course | Your Golf Tours	Carnoustie does not introduce itself gently.

This region of Ireland may be remote but for a keen golf fan it is an unmissable golfing experience. \r\n\r\nTraditional links courses like Enniscrone, County Sligo, Carne and Connemara may not be as famous as Southerly links courses including Doonbeg, Lahinch and Ballybunion but they are equally enjoyable and hold some historic significance. As well as the world class links golf on offer in the North West there are also tree lined courses that have been plotted around the stunning lakes of the region. \r\n\r\nThe Nick Faldo designed course at Lough Erne has been lavished with praise since its opening and is sure to provide the perfect foil for the other courses on this impressive itinerary.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	2011-08-30 15:30:45.044447	2011-09-06 15:44:40.54193	tours	54.393352,-4.746094	7	Ireland	Golf in North West Ireland - Lough Erne, Co.

60	Longniddry Golf Club	longniddry-golf-club	#Longniddry Golf Club\r\n\r\nLongniddry Golf Course is a unique combination of parkland and links located on the south side of Firth of Forth.\r\n\r\nThere are no (men’s) par 5’s although some of the par 4`s are very testing, particularly into the prevailing westerly winds; this is reflected by the SSS of 70 – 2 shots above the par of 68.\r\n\r\nThe course is not long by modern standards, but it is designed to reward the strategic player. The fairways are quite generous and the greens are fairly large, but the penalty for straying off-line can be severe. You will find mature Scots Pines, gorse, sea-buckthorn and punitive rough only too eager to punish the wayward drive. Hit it long, certainly, but you’d better be straight!\r\n\r\nThe opening holes are relatively straightforward and open to the winds of the estuary. From the 3rd green to the 11th tee there is considerable shelter in amongst the trees, but thereafter the course opens out once more.\r\n\r\nThere are many good holes at Longniddry, both as a test of golf and of natural beauty. They include the 450 yard 3rd, which is right on the limit for a par 4; the 305 yard dogleg 5th, with a two-tier elevated green; the 6th, with a shot of 160 yards downhill to the heavily bunkered green and the long 7th. The closing six holes are equally challenging, particularly the dogleg 12th, the par 3 13th and the finishing hole of 418 yards, where par is always welcome.\r\n\r\nThe Club is a former venue of the British Seniors and a qualifier for the Open at Muirfield. More recently the Club has hosted the Ladies Home Internationals and the Commonwealth Youths Tournament. It is a regional qualifier for the Lombard PGA ProAm and a number of other competitions.\r\n\r\nThis area of East Lothian area enjoys a relatively dry climate, with an average long-term rainfall of 14". The course is very free draining and rarely suffers from the indignity of closure, even during the winter. The greens in recent years have been fast and true, and the course itself is invariably in excellent condition. 	2011-08-31 15:15:45.646958	2011-09-08 15:38:08.376439	courses		\N	Scotland	Golf at Longniddry Golf Club, East Lothian, Scotland | Your Golf Tours	Longniddry Golf Course is a unique combination of parkland and links located on the south side of Firth of Forth.

No expense was spared in crafting an unrivalled experience, and Carton House's developers drafted in two of the game's heavy hitters to lay out the courses - Colin Montgomerie and American Mark O'Meara.\r\n\r\nThe Montgomerie Course was the host of the 2005 and 2006 Nissan Irish Opens, and is a monumental championship test; expansive bunkering and the wild grasses of the Emerald Isle set the stage for a tremendous layout. Monty, Europe's Ryder Cup Captain for 2010, drew influence from his favourite courses worldwide, which include Royal Melbourne and Turnberry, in creating what has developed into one of Ireland's premier courses.\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the River Wye is Carton House's other course, the O'Meara. Choose Mark's layout if you feel like a slightly more sedate challenge; less fearsome than the Montgomerie, the O'Meara is an equally enjoyable part of any good Irish golf tour.	2011-08-31 16:02:00.760185	2011-09-13 16:56:42.294067	courses	53.517451,-5.394287	9	Ireland	Golf at Carton House, Ireland | Your Golf Tours	Multiple host to the European Tour's Irish Open, Carton House is a top quality golfing complex with two splendid courses at its heart.

A visit to the Castle has to be included in any trip to Edinburgh. If visiting during the month of August one can experience the Military Tattoo which runs for 3 weeks on the Castle's Esplanade.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Mile is the main tourist area of Edinburgh and stretches from Edinburgh Castle to Hollyrood Palace (the Queen's official Edinburgh residence), where there are many shops and restaurants to sample and also the chance to tour the underground vaults of the Old Town.\r\n\r\nGolf in the area ranges from Dalmahoy in the East across to a fantastic stretch of Scottish links courses including 3 courses at Gullane, North Berwick West Links, Muirfield, Dunbar, Craigielaw and Longniddry.\r\n\r\nThe drive from Edinburgh to Dunbar (the furthest course down the coast) is only about 40 minutes, making a stay in the city centre a very plausible option.

But remember that Scotland has another 5 Open Championship venues past and present, which offer Links golf at its best.\r\n\r\nIn and around St Andrews the keen golfer could play a round on a different course each day and play for 2 weeks without travelling more than 30 minutes to reach a course.\r\n\r\nThe town of St Andrews is one of the largest small towns in Scotland. The university, where Prince William attended, attracts students from all over the world, keeping the bars and restaurants busy during the winter, and during the summer golfers from all over the world descend on the town to play the hallowed Old Course. The town has got a mystical charm about it!\r\n\r\nSt Andrews was home to Old Tom Morris and his son, funnily enough called Young Tom Morris, the youngest ever winner of the Open championship at the age of 17 and won it 4 times in a row. Old and Young Tom Morris dominated the Open's and they won it 8 times between them from 1860-72. However the story of Young Tom Morris is ultimately a tragic one. His wife of one year was taken ill during childbirth and a telegram was dispatched to call Morris to her bedside. It was given to him as he came off the course at North Berwick. While in transit home, another telegram arrived with the grim news that she died. Morris never recovered from the shock. He died of a broken heart some same, a few months later on Christmas Day 1875 at the tender age of 24.\r\n\r\nA memorial was erected at his grave on which was inscribed "Deeply regretted by numerous friends and all golfers, he thrice in succession won the Championship Belt and held it without envy, his many amiable qualities being no less acknowledged than his golfing achievements". His grave is located in the ruined cathedral of St Andrews.\r\n\r\nOld Tom Morris passed away in 1908 at the age of 86.	2011-09-01 16:46:18.728013	2011-09-06 15:46:25.894646	regions		\N	Scotland	Golf in St Andrews, Old Course, Kingsbarns, -  Your Golf Tours	\N

199	Burnham & Berrow Golf Course	burnham-berrow-golf-course	Authentic links golf is the hallmark of Burnham and Berrow, a hidden gem of England's South Western corner that has a loyal following of devout seaside golfers. Since its 1890 inception, Burnham and Berrow has been the proud host to a long list of prestigious national amateur championships, and today still ranks among the most highly regarded coastal courses in England.\r\n\r\nThe original nine holes were expanded in 1910 by Herbert Fowler, whose work included the current finishing hole as well as the famous 'Church Hole'. Fowler's route was more than 6,000 and a decent test, but in 1913 the members sought the help of Harry Colt to make the course even more challenging.\r\n\r\nColt's blueprint included the removal of all blind driving holes, as well as the introduction of a half-dozen fantastic new holes. The 9th and 10th were among the new additions, and for these Colt took advice from Dr. Alister Mackenzie - who later achieved fame by designing Augusta National. These holes now form a key part of the Burnham and Berrow experience, which is central to enjoying a championship golf tour in Cornwall and England's South West.	2011-09-13 10:47:48.587384	2011-09-13 10:48:36.713238	courses		\N	England	Burnham & Berrow Golf Course - South West Golf Tours - YourGolfTours.com	Authentic links golf is the hallmark of Burnham and Berrow, a hidden gem of England's South Western corner that has a loyal following of devout seaside golfers.

As you move westwards over the next few holes, the rugged Grampians come into view on the right, then distantly purple ahead, Ben Vorlich and the mountains above the Trossachs. 	2011-08-31 14:18:55.093421	2011-09-08 15:33:21.376116	courses		\N	Scotland	Golf at Gleneagles - PGA Centenary Course | Your Golf Tours	The PGA Centenary Course, designed by Jack Nicklaus, is a modern classic, combining the best of both earlier designs.
28	Gleneagles Queen's Course	gleneagles-queens-course	#Gleneagles Queen's Course\r\n\r\nThe natural beauty of the Queen`s Course inspires the world`s most experienced players.\r\n\r\nThe Queen`s Course, in its long history, has played host to some of the world`s golfing greats. The beautiful settings and the challenge of the golf have attracted such top golfers as Johnny Miller, Greg Norman, Seve Ballesteros, Tom Watson, and Lee Trevino, as well as great names from the entertainment and sports worlds including Sean Connery, Burt Lancaster, Bing Crosby, Jackie Stewart, and astronaut, Alan Shepard (the only man to hit a golf shot on the moon).\r\n\r\nThreading through high ridges on the north and west sides of the estate, the Queen`s offers lovely woodland settings, lochans and ditches as water hazards, as well as many moorland characteristics.\r\n\r\nAt 3192 yards long, the challenge of the first nine can be deceptive, with even some of the best players finding it a test to make par into a fresh south-westerly breeze.\r\n\r\nDo not be lulled into a sense of false security as you stand on the first tee. The "Trystin` Tree," or lover`s meeting place, after which the hole is named, is a challenging opener. The ground falls away at your feet, the fairway swings round to the left and slopes towards the trees, and there are a couple of cunningly-placed bunkers testing your approach into the miniscule green. 	2011-08-31 14:18:11.322283	2011-09-08 15:33:37.608436	courses		\N	Scotland	Golf at Gleneagles - Queen's Course | Your Golf Tours	Threading through high ridges on the north and west sides of the estate, the Queen`s offers lovely woodland settings, lochans and ditches as water hazards, as well as many moorland characteristics.

In fact, this may well be the best hidden gem in north west England.\r\n\r\nAs you would expect, Hillside is fortunate enough to enjoy the same sandy soil and ancient dunes as its more illustrious stablemate, and it is this classic links terrain that forms the building blocks of a truly wonderful layout.\r\n\r\nRich in variety, Hillside winds through the dunes in all directions, presenting golfers with any number of different viewpoints and challenges, and is home to a number of outstanding holes.\r\n\r\nFavourites with many are the short 10th, whose raised green is framed by trees and cavernous bunkers, and the iconic 11th, whose fairway winds right then left. All around Hillside you will enjoy a mature, fair yet challenging proposition, and one that flies under the radar as one of the UK's very best coastal courses.	2011-08-31 15:40:38.433488	2011-09-08 15:34:34.380291	courses		\N	England	Golf at Hillside Golf Club, North West England | Your Golf Tours	Hillside is the next door neighbour of Royal Birkdale, regarded by many to be the best links course in England, and while Birkdale's reputation casts long shadows, there is no reason for Hillside to be regarded as inferior.

Well defined fairways and quick greens complement this tight, short course.  Several holes border the shoreline, adding another challenge to a rather unforgiving course. \r\n\r\nHazards include the beach, heavy rough and strategically placed bunkers.  All in, this course is a demanding but worthwhile challenge.   \r\n\r\nKilspindie is host bi-annually to the alternative Ryder cup - a match played by 12 Americans against 12 Europeans, using pre 1930's hickories! 	2011-08-31 15:15:03.01778	2011-09-08 15:34:52.479287	courses		\N	Scotland	Golf at Kilspindie Golf Club, Scotland | Your Golf Tours	Created in 1898 by Ben Sayers and Alex MacKenzie Ross, this course is steeped in history and offers wonderful views from each hole.

As the short ascent is made from the 7th green, it is as if a theatrical curtain is opened to reveal a stunning set. The extra elevation multiplies the panorama that stretches in every direction, but the shots, too, are breathtaking.\r\n\r\nThese range from a delicate pitch in a rocky dell on the 8th to a thrilling second along the shoreline on the 9th. Widely regarded as the Kintyre`s signature hole, the 8th, involves a drive from an elevated tee towards the sea and an unforgettable blind second shot to the green set in a gully by the rocks.\r\n\r\nUnseen from the tee, hidden by a narrow ridge, the green is in a cove that seems to merge with the craggy beach beyond. As for the 9th, an invigorating drive offers the choice between adventure and caution, a par 5 set against the background of the renowned symbols of Turnberry, Ailsa Craig and the Lighthouse. 	2011-08-31 15:20:02.734247	2011-09-08 15:36:55.403303	courses		\N	Scotland	Golf at Turnberry, Kintyre Course | Your Golf Tours	Building on the challenges laid down by the famous old Arran course, the Kintyre is links golf at its exhilarating best.

70	Lochgreen Course, Troon	lochgreen-course-troon	#Lochgreen Course, Troon\r\n\r\nLochgreen is the best of the trio of municipal courses on the east side of the popular holiday town of Troon.\r\n\r\nThey each offer an excellent golfing experience and at a fraction of the royal fee charged at their more aristocratic neighbours. Lochgreen is the longer course, a Par 74 running parallel at points to Royal Troon and used for several years as a qualifier for the Open. Jack Nicklaus shot an 82 here in an Open Qualifier followed by a more appropriate 68 making the cut buy one shot.\r\n\r\nAlthough Lochgreen is predominately a links type course, the layout is truly varied, with one stretch - known as the `Dovecot Section` - providing holes of a more parkland type character. The course has several holes that are reminiscent of its royal neighbour and one hole in particular - the fifth - would do justice to any championship test.\r\n\r\nAt well over 400 yards the hole runs parallel to the same railway that borders the championship course, with bunkers and gorse providing additional hazards. The par three that follows offers no respite and the golfer who misses the gorse-surrounded green would do well to play a provisional ball.\r\n\r\nIt was during the 1962 Open qualifier that Australian Kel Nagle set the present course record of 65, with the amateur record of 66 being set at the same time by Martin Christmas. Both golfers doubtless celebrated their feats in the Bunker Bar and Restaurant that forms part of the spacious clubhouse shared by Darley, Lochgreen and Fullarton.	2011-08-31 15:26:50.973463	2011-09-08 15:37:58.819043	courses		\N	Scotland	Golf at Troon, Lochgreen Course | Your Golf Tours	Lochgreen is the best of the trio of municipal courses on the east side of the popular holiday town of Troon.

Prestwick shares it boundaries with Royal Troon and is just 20 minutes from Turnberry, with Open final qualifying courses such as Kilmarnock Barassie, Glasgow Gailes, Western Gailes and Irvine Bogside all within just 5 minutes drive.\r\n\r\nThe first Open championship was held at Prestwick in 1860 and was organised by the members who subscribed £25 to purchase the red morocco belt with silver clasps. It was won by Willie Park of Musselburgh with a score of 174 over 36 holes. The belt was won in three successive years by Young Tom Morris from 1868 to 1870 and thus became his property. When Morris won for the third time, in 1870, he had a first round score of 47 (over 12 holes) was has never been equalled or bettered. He started with a three at the 578yard first hole that in those days was probably a par 6. His Belt is now in the keeping of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St.Andrews. A replica belt was presented to Sandy Lyle, the winner of the 125th Anniversary Open Championship at Royal St.Georges Golf Club in 1985, another is on display in the Cardinal room in the Prestwick clubhouse.\r\n\r\nThere was no Championship in1871, and thereafter Prestwick, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St.Andrews, and the Honourable Company of Edinburgh joined forces to purchase the current Claret Jug, played for in the Open Championship for £30. When the Championship was revived in 1872 Young Tom won again, thus winning the Open Four times in a row. A feat no other Golfer has ever matched, or likely will. In 1914 Harry Vardon won the Open for a record sixth time, three victories of which were won at Prestwick.\r\n\r\nA stone cairn to the west of the Clubhouse, marks the first tee of the original 12 hole course, from which the first Open was played. The 1st hole measured 578 yards to what is now the 16th green, where in 1870 Tom Morris Jr holed out in three strokes using hickory shafts and a gutty golf ball. Seven of the original greens are still played on today.	2011-08-31 14:08:06.502268	2011-09-08 15:45:59.570606	courses		\N	Scotland	Golf at Prestwick Golf Club, Scotland | Your Golf Tours	Prestwick Golf Club is situated just half an hour south west of Glasgow on the famous golfing Ayrshire coast, a stretch of land unequalled anywhere in the world for prime golfing terrain.

45	Royal Dornoch	royal-dornoch	#Royal Dornoch\r\n\r\nIn 2002 the Club celebrated 125 years since its foundation, but that understates the history of Royal Dornoch by at least a long drive with a jumbo driver.\r\n\r\nCenturies before a golf club was formed at Dornoch, the game of golf was recorded as being played in 1616 on the town lands on the links along the seashore. The Club is proud to play on the third of the first three golf links in Scotland following St Andrews 1552 and Leith 1593.\r\n\r\nA number of prestigious golf architects have contributed to the present course layout. Old Tom Morris was first invited to set out "proper holes" by the secretary John Sutherland who in his 53 years in office also had some input to the design. Donald Ross before he sailed to America to become one of the worlds highly regarded golf course architects was Professional and Head Green Keeper and some holes bear his hallmark. After the war, to replace some holes that had been levelled, George Duncan laid out 5-6 new holes on land purchased from the Duke of Sutherland.\r\n\r\nThis piecemeal approach belies the suggestion that a camel is a horse designed by a committee, but it does not mean that the Club makes a habit of tinkering with the layout. While recognising the need for evolution, the case for any change to the course needs to be made very strongly before anything is touched and those returning even after a period of some years will be comfortable with familiar features.	2011-08-31 15:02:12.044165	2011-09-08 15:48:32.809739	courses		\N	Scotland	Golf at Royal Dornoch, Scotland | Your Golf Tours	Centuries before a golf club was formed at Dornoch, the game of golf was recorded as being played in 1616 on the town lands on the links along the seashore.

32	St Andrews Castle Course	st-andrews-castle-course	#St Andrews Castle Course\r\n\r\nDavid McLay Kidd and his team have transformed featureless farmland into an exciting links-like challenge set above the cliff-tops at Kinkell.\r\n\r\nKidd takes his place among a select group, for the list of course architects who have worked at St Andrews is in itself remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe Castle Course at St Andrews will have an unparalleled pedigree, joining a family of courses that have attracted the very best players in the history of the game as well as untold thousands of golfers eager to experience for themselves the thrill of the ancient links, which were given over to the people of the town in 1123 by King David I of Scotland.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Castle Course is not a links course it has been designed with the Scottish links tradition very much in mind. The approaches to the green will be similar to the greens themselves so that running shots will be playable as well as pitches. Also in the Scottish tradition, the grasses being cultivated at the site are a bent and fescue mix.\r\n\r\nFescues will also feature strongly in the extensive areas of natural rough and wild meadow which will provide a variety of habitats for wildlife including the very rare maiden pink species which has been found on the 220 acre (90 hectare) site. The construction of the Castle Course has been a model development, with full consideration given to environmental factors.\r\n\r\nThe experience of playing the Castle Course will be a treat for the senses. The North Sea is a visible presence on every hole while the view towards St Andrews is one of the finest possible.	2011-08-31 14:24:45.618433	2011-09-08 15:51:08.524933	courses		\N	Scotland	Golf at St Andrews Castle Course, Scotland | Your Golf Tours	The experience of playing the Castle Course will be a treat for the senses.

30	St Andrews New Course	st-andrews-new-course	#St Andrews New Course\r\n\r\nOpened in April 1895, the course was built in response to increasing demand for golf at St Andrews, both from locals and from the visitors who were flocking to the town in increasing numbers on the recently constructed railway.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the New Course was paid for by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club as part of an arrangement under which the club was allocated the right to certain starting times on the Old Course. These arrangements were enshrined in the first Act of Parliament concerning the Links which was passed in 1894 and was the forerunner of the current Act of 1974 which specifies how the links are to be run.\r\n\r\nThe R&A engaged W Hall Blyth, an Edinburgh civil engineer, to design the New Course, and entrusted the layout to "Old" Tom Morris and his right-hand man David Honeyman.\r\n\r\nThe result is a classic links course which uses the natural features of the land to create a first class golfing challenge. The course has the traditional out and back layout, with the 18th green just to the right of the first tee. It also has, in the great St Andrews tradition, shared fairways and even a double green at the 3rd and 15th holes.\r\n\r\nIt has frequently been said that if the New Course were not situated next to the Old, then its star would have shone with a far greater degree of brilliance.\r\n\r\nLocated as it is in the shadow of its illustrious neighbour, the New Course can be considered one of St Andrews` best kept secrets.	2011-08-31 14:22:58.382115	2011-09-08 15:51:35.895071	courses		\N	Scotland	Golf at St Andrews New Course, Scotland | Your Golf Tours	Opened in April 1895, the course was built in response to increasing demand for golf at St Andrews, both from locals and from the visitors who were flocking to the town in increasing numbers on the recently constructed railway.
21	St Andrews Old Course	st-andrews-old-course	#St Andrews Old Course\r\n\r\n"I fell in love with it the first day I played it. There's just no other golf course that is even remotely close." Jack Nicklaus\r\n\r\n"Without a doubt I like it the best of all the Open venues. It's my favourite course in the world." Tiger Woods\r\n\r\nThe oldest golf course in the world has many remarkable features which help make it so special to golfers around the world.\r\nIt is the Home of Golf where golf was first played 600 years ago and yet it remains a real test of golf for today's champions. Despite its reputation and status, it is a public course and is one of six public courses on St Andrews Links.\r\n\r\nThe Old Course has evolved over time and was not designed by any one architect. The people who played a major role in shaping it are Daw Anderson (1850s), Old Tom Morris (1860s- 1900) and Dr Alister Mackenzie (1930s).\r\n\r\nThe course is known for its particular physical features including 112 bunkers, some of which are especially famous e.g. 'Hell' on the long 14th, 'Strath' on the short 11th and the Road Bunker at what is probably the most famous golf hole in the world, the 17th or Road Hole (so called because a road - which is in play - runs hard against the back edge of the green).\r\n\r\nAnother peculiar feature of the Old Course is the double greens where the outward and inward holes are cut on the same putting surface. These greens are large, not surprisingly, and golfers can be faced with putts of almost 100 yards.\r\n\r\nThe Old Course is also unusual in that it starts and finishes in the town, but its truly remarkable feature is that in today's modern golfing world, a course which has evolved over six centuries, remains a true test of championship golf.\r\n\r\nFor a guaranteed tee time it is recommended to book at least one year in advance of your visit. The other courses follow a similar procedure. The Old Course is also available through the daily ballot or by advance reservation request.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us to secure a coveted tee time reservation.	2011-08-31 14:04:09.9967	2011-09-08 15:51:56.479483	courses		\N	Scotland	Golf at St Andrews Old Course, Scotland | Your Golf Tours	The oldest golf course in the world has many remarkable features which help make it so special to golfers around the world.

200	Saunton Golf Course	saunton-golf-course	Saunton occupies a prestigious position among the elite of links golf in the United Kingdom, with two top class courses and a setting that must be seen to be believed. The East Course is the more senior of the duo, and is consistently ranked in the country's top 100 courses; in fact, many astute observers believe that Saunton has the quality to host the Open Championship.\r\n\r\nThe East Course, designed by Herbert Fowler, is in fact often on the fringes of England's top ten courses, and is set against the irresistable backdrop of the Braunton Burrows sand dunes, which have been marked as a point of environmental interest by UNESCO. Fowler's routing of the monumental East Course reaches around 6,700 yards, which is short by modern championship standards, but the daunting collection of strong par-4s and the near ever-present wind make Saunton's East Course a brute. Not only that, it is one of the very best to include in a golf tour of England's South West.\r\n\r\nWhile the East Course takes most of the plaudits, Saunton's West Course should never be underestimated. Originally opened in the 1930s, the West was subsequently used as an air force training field, and fell into disrepair for some four decades. 1975 saw the esteemed Frank Pennink draw up plans for the course's revival, and it is now a hugely enjoyable and challenging links golf experience.	2011-09-13 10:54:35.077736	2011-09-13 10:58:24.735449	courses		\N	England	Saunton Golf Course, South West Golf Tours - YourGolfTours.com	Saunton occupies a prestigious position among the elite of links golf in the United Kingdom, with two top class courses and a setting that must be seen to be believed.
